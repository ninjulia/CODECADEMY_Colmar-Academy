## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- VS Code

### What I learned

The wireframe intentionally omitted information to test student's ability to fill in the gaps. If I were working with a team, I would ask some clarifying questions regarding interactivity and the intent behind hiding information on mobile views. From the wireframes, it's not clear what should be linked to another page or how some modules might be used in the future. An academy would most certainly have more than one page of content, and a CMS as well. As a result, what you see here is what I'd call an early prototype, a tool to spark more conversations, perfect for internal design or user flow testing.

Most of the changes I made to the design were for accessability reasons, such as showing all content regardless of screen size. The header and navigation were modified to always show the full logo and include clarifying text under each of the icons on mobile.

In addition, I used Javascript to enhance functionality of the "Start learning" and "Thesis exhibits" section. For the Start learning cards on screens larger than 768px wide, I added Javascript to make the entire card clickable, not just the linked title now that more content was visible.

### Continued development

This was a great opportunity to practice my front end coding skills without relying on any frameworks or tooling. There are a lot of questions that the provided wireframes did not touch on, such as interactivity and desired layouts between mobile and desktop views. These are things that would be easily addressed while working with a team and asking questions.

If that were the case, I would start by building out "design tiles" showcasing the header, typography, color and link / button elements to start with a good foundation and identify commonalities between pages / components before jumping into a full page design.
